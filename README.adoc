A JUnit test rule for pending tests: those which pass up to a point, and then fail in a known and, for the time being, acceptable way.

While working at TIM Group, i had the pleasure of working with Tony Tsui's https://github.com/ttsui/pending[PendingRule]. This library is an attempt to implement the same idea in a slightly different way.
